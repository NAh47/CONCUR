# Game Objective

The aim is to strategically organize your cards into a winning pattern of 4-3-3-3. This pattern can be achieved through a combination of sets, which can be formed in two distinct ways:

- **By Rank:** Assembling cards of the same rank, with each card from a different suit. For instance, a set of four 7s would be 7♠ 7♥ 7♦ 7♣, representing each suit.
- **By Sequence:** Collecting consecutive cards all within the same suit. A sequence set could be 10♣ J♣ Q♣ K♣, ranging from 10 to King in Clubs.

**Combining Set Types:** Players have the flexibility to mix these two methods in forming their overall 4-3-3-3 pattern. For example, your winning pattern could consist of:
- A set of four by rank: 7♠ 7♥ 7♦ 7♣
- A set of three by sequence: 2♦ 3♦ 4♦
- Another set of three by rank: Q♠ Q♥ Q♦
- And a final set of three by sequence: A♠ 2♠ 3♠

## Setup

- **Decks:** The game uses two standard decks of cards.
- **Shuffling:** Thoroughly shuffle both decks together before starting.
- **Dealing:** Deal 13 cards to each player. The dealer receives 14 cards. The remainder of the cards form the draw pile, placed aside. The center of the table will serve to collect discarded cards, starting with the dealer's initial discard.

## The Dealer

- The role of the dealer rotates clockwise after each game.
- The dealer initiates the game by discarding one of their extra cards to the discard pile, thus starting with the same number of cards as other players (13).

## Game Play

### Taking Turns

Players take turns in a clockwise direction. On their turn, a player must:

- **Draw:** Pick the top card from the draw pile or the discard pile. However, drawing from the discard pile is only allowed if the player has previously dropped a set totaling to 41 points.
- **Discard:** Each player ends their turn by discarding one card, maintaining a hand size of 13 cards.

## Special Cards

### Jokers

- **Substitute:** Jokers can act as a substitute for any card to help complete any set, whether it’s for sets of the same rank or consecutive sequences.
- **Double Win on Discard:** If the game involves stakes, discarding a Joker as the final action to complete your 4-3-3-3 formation doubles your winnings. This means if you finish the game by discarding a Joker, you earn twice the amount staked by each player or according to the pre-agreed rules.

### Aces

- **Flexible Value:** The Ace card can be used either as a 1 to start a sequence or as a 14 to follow a King, offering flexibility in building sets of consecutive cards. This dual value allows for strategic set formations.

## Forming Sets

- **Types of Sets:** Sets can be formed with cards of the same rank (all cards must be from different suits) or with consecutive cards of the same suit. This rule applies to both groups of three and four.
- **The 41 Rule for Drawing from the Discard Pile:** A player can only draw from the discard pile after placing a qualifying set (or sets) on the table that adheres to the game's rules for combinations, specifically aiming for a total set value of 41 points. Points are calculated based on the sets formed, not the numeric value of the cards.
- **Expanding Sets:** If a player has previously laid down sets totaling 41 points and finds a card that can turn a set of three into a set of four (quadrupling the set), they can add this card to the set during their turn, but once done, the quartet can’t never be changed back to a trio.

## Hand Size

Players must always have exactly 13 cards in their hand after their turn ends. Any deviation from this—having more or less than 13 cards at any point—results in immediate disqualification.

## Winning the Game

The game ends when a player successfully arranges their cards into the 4-3-3-3 formation and discards any excess card. To win, the final arrangement must not include two consecutive cards of the same color within any set.

## Disqualification

Failure to maintain a hand size of 13 cards at any time will lead to disqualification. Additionally, players must adhere to all rules regarding set formation and drawing from the discard pile to remain in the game.
